# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

A simple Weather Android app where I learned how to implement Retrofit, Gson, MVVM architecture, and Navigation. The app fetches weather data using the free version of the OpenWeather API and manages API requests and responses efficiently.

## Features
- Fetch real-time weather data using OpenWeather API.
- Implement MVVM architecture for better separation of concerns.
- Use Retrofit and Gson for API requests and JSON parsing.
- Navigation component for smooth screen transitions.
- Custom app icon, splash screen, and static background created using Canva.

## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin** with Jetpack Compose
- **Retrofit** for API requests
- **Gson** for JSON parsing
- **MVVM** architecture
- **Navigation Component** for screen navigation
- **OpenWeather API** for weather data
- **Canva** for UI assets (app icon, splash screen, background)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Add your OpenWeather API key in `local.properties`:
   ```properties
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.

## API Configuration
- Register on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to get a free API key.
- Add the API key to your project as shown in the Setup & Installation section.
